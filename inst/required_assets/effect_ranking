splice_acceptor_variant	2	A splice variant that changes the 2 base region at the 3 end of an intron
stop_gained	3	A sequence variant whereby at least one base of a codon is changed, resulting in a premature stop codon, leading to a shortened transcript
frameshift_variant	3	A sequence variant which causes a disruption of the translational reading frame, because the number of nucleotides inserted or deleted is not a multiple of three

conservative_inframe_insertion	5	An inframe increase in cds length that inserts one or more codons into the coding sequence between existing codons
conservative_inframe_deletion	5	An inframe decrease in cds length that deletes one or more entire codons from the coding sequence but does not change any remaining codons

inframe_deletion	5	An inframe non synonymous variant that deletes bases from the coding sequence
protein_altering_variant	5	A sequence variant which is predicted to change the protein encoded in the coding sequence
missense_variant	6	A sequence variant, that changes one or more bases, resulting in a different amino acid sequence but where the length is preserved

start_retained_variant	9	A sequence variant where at least one base in the start codon is changed, but the start remains
stop_retained_variant	9	A sequence variant where at least one base in the terminator codon is changed, but the terminator remains
