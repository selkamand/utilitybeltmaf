TEC	6	To be Experimentally Confirmed. This is used for non-spliced EST clusters that have polyA features. This category has been specifically created for the ENCODE project to highlight regions that could indicate the presence of protein coding genes that require experimental validation, either by 5 RACE or RT-PCR to extend the transcripts, or by confirming expression of the putatively-encoded peptide with specific antibodies

retained_intron	7	Alternatively spliced transcript believed to contain intronic sequence relative to other, coding, variants
nonsense_mediated_decay	7	If the coding sequence (following the appropriate reference) of a transcript finishes >50bp from a downstream splice site then it is tagged as NMD. If the variant does not cover the full reference coding sequence then it is annotated as NMD if NMD is unavoidable i.e. no matter what the exon structure of the missing portion is the transcript will be subject to NMD
non_stop_decay	7	Transcripts that have polyA features (including signal) without a prior stop codon in the CDS, i.e. a non-genomic polyA tail attached directly to the CDS without 3 UTR. These transcripts are subject to degradation
ambiguous_orf	7	Transcript believed to be protein coding, but with more than one possible open reading frame
pseudogene	8	Have homology to proteins but generally suffer from a disrupted coding sequence and an active homologous gene can be found at another locus. Sometimes these entries have an intact coding sequence or an open but truncated ORF, in which case there is other evidence used (for example genomic polyA stretches at the 3 end) to classify them as a pseudogene. Can be further classified as one of the following
processed_pseudogene	8	Pseudogene that lack introns and is thought to arise from reverse transcription of mRNA followed by reinsertion of DNA into the genome
polymorphic_pseudogene	8	Pseudogene owing to a SNP/DIP but in other individuals/haplotypes/strains the gene is translated
retrotransposed	8	Pseudogene owing to a reverse transcribed and re-inserted sequence
translated_processed_pseudogene	8	Pseudogenes that have mass spec data suggesting that they are also translated
translated_unprocessed_pseudogene	8	Pseudogenes that have mass spec data suggesting that they are also translated
transcribed_processed_pseudogene	8	Pseudogene where protein homology or genomic structure indicates a pseudogene, but the presence of locus-specific transcripts indicates expression
